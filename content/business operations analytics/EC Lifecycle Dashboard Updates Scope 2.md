There is an Engineering Change object, with Tasks associated with it. The EC parent has a status and the task has its own status. 

We used these 2 different statuses to identify stagnant ECs. The last completed task may be a long time ago, but there may be a status update recently -> shows that it is being worked on actively even if not fully completed.

We can compare statuses to ensure alignment -> all tasks comp = main EC comp

ECs without related work orders -> data validation check of the existing databases.
